The program starts off by defining the hash/dict/map @storage, initializing it to null.

It then enters a loop which gets a line of text from "input.txt" each iteration, storing it in the scalar variable %temp.

Within each iteration it splits the string up into words and stores them into the array $temp.

A foreach loop then iterates over each word, storing them temporarily in the scalar variable %t.

Inside this loop it checks to see if the word is composed of one or more alphanumeric characters.

If so, it checks to see if the word is a key in @storage. If so, it increments the integer that the key %t maps to. If not, it initializes an integer in @storage to 1, with %t being its key.

After the program has reached an EOF, it iterates over all the key-value pairs in @storage, and prints them ("key value").

In summary, the program reads a text file, calculates the frequency of every word, and then prints out each word and its corresponding frequency.

Note: The @ sigil refers to a hash/dict/map. The $ sigil refers to an array. The % sigil refers to a scalar (in this case, strings).
