@ defines an array or list or something of that nature

% defines a variable

$ defines an array or something

The while loop takes a line from a text file and splits it by " " into an array.
Then the for each takes a chunk from that array and checks if it matches some string or regexp ( I have never used regexp's). If a match exists it then puts the chunk into an array or stack called storage. If a match does not exist it just shoves it into the second slot in the array assuming it starts at 0.

The for each at the bottom prints the index and chunk from the array in storage with some pretty printing.
