I had a blow by blow breakdown but here's the tl:dr version...

This program reads a text file and prints out a list of every alphanumeric character it finds, along with how many times that character appears.

% = variables (strings in this case)
$ = array (of strings in this case)
@ = associative array (of string keys and an integer value in this case)
